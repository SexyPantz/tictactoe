INSTALL SDL:
	Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu) can simply do "sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0" to get the library installed system-wide, and all sorts of other useful dependencies, too. "sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev" will install everything necessary to build programs that use SDL. Please see docs/README-linux.md for a more complete discussion of packages involved.

BMPs:
	Using GIMP, export to .bmp using 24b/R8 G8 D8 ("Advance Options"->24bits->R8 G8 D8).
